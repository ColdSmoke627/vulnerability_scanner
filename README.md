# vulnerability_scanner

## What it does:

Searches for vulnerabilities (CVEs) by estimated CPEs for the installed packages and stores everything inside a sqlite database.
Currently just supported for dpkg based operating systems like Ubuntu.

## Tested on:

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

## Todo list:

- Support for other linux distributions (Debian, Red Hat, Solaris, SLES ...)
- Improvement of usability and design
- Improvement of identifying CPEs and their CVEs
- Web application for graphical reports, lists and management of vulnerabilities
- Secured API interface to get client's vulnerabilities (json, xml, csv)
- Connect more sources with vulnerability information
- Maybe support for Windows and MacOS

## Installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinoloni/vulnerability_scanner.git
cd vulnerability_scanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
